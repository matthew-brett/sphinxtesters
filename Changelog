0.2.3

Bugfix release : 7 August 2019

* Read config when creating TestApp, to allow user to specify master document.

*****
0.2.2
*****

Bugfix release : 6 August 2019

* Refactor against Sphinx 2.0 release.  Technically this results in an API
  change, because I removed the `reset_class` function from `sphinxutils`.
  Sorry about that.

*****
0.2.1
*****

Bugfix release

* Refactor against upcoming Sphinx 1.8 release.  The only obvious change is
  that ``TempApp`` now builds into a ``build`` subdirectory, to avoid a new
  Sphinx error for applications that have the same source and build
  directories.

***
0.2
***

Feature release.

* Refactor to make ``SourcesBuilder`` the default class for builds from
  template and via strings.
* work round changes in Sphinx warnings for files not in toctree.  By default
  string-based pages are ignored for the toctree, and we do not put any pages
  into the toctree by default.  Use new ``toctree_pages`` class attribute to
  put pages into the toctree.
* Allow master documents other than ``contents.rst`` by reading ``conf.py``
  for the ``master_doc`` variable.

*****
0.1.1
*****

Bugfix release.

* Improve error handling
